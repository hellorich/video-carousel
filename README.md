## Installation

Node and the Node Package Manager are the easiest way to set up Grunt and its dependencies for **Go**.

These instructions currently apply to OS X Mavericks 10.9.5 and are not tested on any other platform.

1.  Install Node.js using the instructions [here](http://nodejs.org/).
2.  Install Grunt using the command `npm install -g grunt-cli`. More detailed instructions are available at [gruntjs.com](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started).
3.  Download the latest version of **Go** from [here](https://github.com/Frobitz/go/archive/master.zip) and unzip it into your projects directory root.
4.  Install **Go** dependencies by running `npm install`.
5.  Once all dependencies are downloaded you can begin monitoring the SASS, Jade and image directories by running the command `grunt serve` in the project root.
